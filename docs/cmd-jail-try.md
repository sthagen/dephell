# dephell jail try

Try python packages in an isolated environment.

Try [textdistance](https://github.com/orsinium/textdistance):

```bash
$ dephell jail try textdistance
INFO creating venv... (python=/usr/local/bin/python3.7, venv=/tmp/tmpgixqt4_q)
INFO build dependencies graph...
INFO installation... (executable=/tmp/tmpgixqt4_q/bin/python3.7, packages=1)
Collecting textdistance==4.1.3 (from -r /tmp/tmpduyecsir/requirements.txt (line 2))
Installing collected packages: textdistance
Successfully installed textdistance-4.1.3

```

In this example DepHell installs latest `texdistance` release in a temporary virtual environment and runs python interpreter with already imported `textdistance` inside.

Use [ipython](https://ipython.org/) instead of standard python interpreter:

```bash
$ dephell jail try --command=ipython textdistance
```

Set python version:

```bash
$ dephell jail try --python=3.5 textdistance
...

Install flake8 and plugin for it and run checks on given path:

```bash
$ dephell jail try --command="flake8 ./dephell" flake8 flake8-commas
```
